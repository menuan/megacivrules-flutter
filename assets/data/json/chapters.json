Each step on this timeline represents a certain period of time in history reaching from the Stone Age. Advancement there will provide ever more Victory Points. The winner will not necessarily be the first player to reach the end of the A.S.T. or the player with the highest number of cities or Civilization Advances, although these are the key factors in determining the winner.",

He came across the forum and after a while John and Flo decided to work together to take this shared idea to a higher level. They worked on the design, artwork and simplicity to this enormous game which now accomodates up to 18 players. At first it was just an extension to the original game, but now they started working on the game from scratch. No single detail was safe. Rules would change radically, new ideas were launched and sometimes failed and years went by testing, testing, changing, testing, adding, removing,  testing, changing and testing again. For years, each with their own group of players on either side of the ocean,  John and Flo kept discussing their findings and fully redesigned the first idea to the game it is today. As each game takes a full day and requires a group of people to play, the effort to perform the most comprehensive testing was a real challenge.",
